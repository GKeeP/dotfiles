## My collection of scripts

#### battery_notifications
Port of [this script](https://www.reddit.com/r/UsabilityPorn/comments/cohogi/usability_tip_hack_together_a_low_battery_warning/) from fish to bash with a bit of personal preference.

To enable add `* * * * * /usr/bin/bash /home/<path to the script>/battery_notifications` to your crontab.

### dmenu scripts:

#### exit_dmenu
Lock, logout, suspend, shutdown or reboot.

#### nordvpn_dmenu
Connect to fastest server; connect to fastest server in specific country; disconnect from NordVPN.

### i3 scripts:

#### blurlock
Use blurred image of whatever you were doing and use it as i3lock background

#### blurlock_old
Same as blurlock but using ImageMagick

#### i3exit
i3 exit script I was using before creating exit_dmenu. Use this if you're using i3bar, otherwise use exit_dmenu.

### Other scripts:

#### installtermite_voidlinux.sh
Script to easily install termite on Void Linux.

#### colorcheck
Print all 256 colors. Use this to check if your terminal emulator supports 256 colors.
